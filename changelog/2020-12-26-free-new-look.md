Happy to announce we have moved our old documentation to [**Docusaurus 2**](https://v2.docusaurus.io/) 🦖🎉

Previously we were writing React and HTML for our information pages but that became hard to maintain. We adopted this open-source platform and in less than 2 days we were live again.

Because in Flayyer.com we love open-source, all of this guides and docs and changelogs are open to the public via our GitHub repository: https://github.com/flayyer/flayyer-docs.

**Feel free to contribute 😃**
